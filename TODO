- [delsig] Look into quadrature modulators
- [delsig] implement findPattern
- [delsig] implement calculateSNR
- [delsig] implement simulateSNR
- [simulator] reuse common code between _simulateDSM_scipy_blas and
    _simulateDSM_cblas
- [simulator] verify speed difference between scipy_blas and cblas simulator
    possibly including an fblas simulator in the picture and trying
    different matrix representations (C, fortran)
- implement quadratic form
- implement scanner with quadratic form
- [sdtoolbox] implement calcSNR
- [sdtoolbox] sinusx
- [documentation] add tutorial
- [cython] in the cython simulator use np.double and np.intc for casting
- maybe move zpk and ba representations to named tuple model or to LTI
    representations
- avoid __import__ statements and follow
    http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/api.html
- [api] rename quantization_noise_gain as quantization_filtered_noise_gain
- [api] thoroughly clean up the synthesizeNTF_from_filter interface
    argument should be a zpk or a ba tuple only
    impulse response case goes in the ba with a=[1] and b=response
    magnitude function response goes in synthesizeNTF_from_weighting
- [api] provide a legacy module for methods that are now superceeded by
    better strategies but that may be needed for reproducing results from
    papers
- [api] rename synthesizeNTF_from_noise_weighting into
    synthesizeNTF_from_weighting
- [docstring] possibly move some documentation in the module level docstrings,
    so that it is available in IDEs
- [cython] user numpy.require to assure that arrays have the right properties
- [optimization] move to the newer cvxpy
- [optimization] check picos too for the optimization backend
- [python] make python3 compatible
- [python] make pep8 clean
- [examples] provide notebook version of the examples
- [setuptools] assure that setuptools build the package before calling
    build_sphinx
- [setuptools] make docdist pass options to build_sphinx
- [documentation] Maybe use the versionadded/versionchanged/deprecated sphinx
    features to document api changes
- [*examples*] The numeric results in the ICECS 2012 paper are not consistent
    with what the sample script returns. Specifically, the SNR values
    evaluated via the NTF on the paper are better than those obtained by
    the code by a factor 2. In the original version of the code, the results
    where identical due to a missing factor 2 in the quantization noise gain
    evaluation. Probably, this error slipped in because it makes the NTF-based
    results and the time-domain-simulation results more similar. In fact, the
    'real' modulator behavior is better than predicted by the NTF model
    because in the specific example the quantization noise is not white,
    but for some reason slightly blue (more power at higher frequencies).
    A note should probably be added to the code and to the ArXiv version of
    the ICECS paper.
