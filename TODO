    features to document api changes
- [*examples*] The numeric results in the ICECS 2012 paper are not consistent
    with what the sample script returns. Specifically, the SNR values
    evaluated via the NTF on the paper are better than those obtained by
    the code by a factor 2. In the original version of the code, the results
    where identical due to a missing factor 2 in the quantization noise gain
    evaluation. Probably, this error slipped in because it makes the NTF-based
    results and the time-domain-simulation results more similar. In fact, the
    'real' modulator behavior is better than predicted by the NTF model
    because in the specific example the quantization noise is not white,
    but for some reason slightly blue (more power at higher frequencies).
    A note should probably be added to the code and to the ArXiv version of
    the ICECS paper.
- [accuracy] A recent code change removes a matrix inversion noticing that
    the matrix is orthonormal, and that transposition should suffice.  However
    this seems to cause come accuracy issues on some platforms (AMD?)
