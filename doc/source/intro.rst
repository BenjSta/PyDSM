Introduction
------------

PyDSM is a Python Delta Sigma Modulator toolbox. It contains tools for
experimenting with ΔΣ modulators. Currently, it is still relatively
reduced and focuses mostly on the experimentation of different
techniques for the design of the modulator Noise Transfer Function
(NTF). Furthermore, the current codebase contains means to simulate a
generic modulator.

PyDSM is under development and shall be enriched with further
functionalities in a near future.

Highlights of the current version consist in:

* Some routines ported from the very well known DELSIG Toolbox for
  Matlab by R. Schreier
* The NTF design algorithm presented in:

    Sergio Callegari, Federico Bizzarri *"Output Filter Aware
    Optimization of the Noise Shaping Properties of ΔΣ Modulators via
    Semi-Definite Programming"*, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and
    Systems - Part I: Regular Papers. To appear in 2013.
